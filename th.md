### Template Functions and Pipelines in Helm
* Helm's templating engine, based on Go templates, provides powerful features to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests. Two key components of this are template functions and pipelines.
#### Template Functions
* Built-in Functions: Helm provides a rich set of built-in functions that can be used within templates. These functions cover various aspects, including:
** String Manipulation: quote, upper, lower, trim, replace.
** Mathematical Operations: add, sub, mul, div.
** Data Structures: list, dict, index, range.
** Conditional Logic: if, else, and, or, not.
** YAML and JSON: toYaml, toJson, fromYaml, fromJson.
** Helm-Specific Functions: include, required, tpl.
** Custom Functions: You can define custom functions within your Helm charts using Go templates.

#### Pipelines
* Chaining Functions: Pipelines allow you to chain multiple template functions together, passing the output of one function as the input to the next.
* Syntax: Pipelines use the | (pipe) character to separate functions.
* Example:
```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: {{ .Release.Name }}-configmap
data:
  myvalue: {{ .Values.myvalue | quote | upper }}
```
